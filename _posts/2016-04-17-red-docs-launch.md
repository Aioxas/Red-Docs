Today we launched the Red-Docs website, which should help people wrap their heads around Red and discordpy in general.

If you want to add any docs or guides to the repo, you can make a Pull Request following a bunch of simple rules, found in readme on github.

If you have any questions or suggestions, you are free to ask in #general or #support
