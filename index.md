Red has been completely rewritten. It is now fully modular and it comes with sets of features/commands that can be enabled/disabled to your liking, making it customizable exactly how you want.  
You can turn Red into a trivia bot, an admin bot, a music bot (...) or all of these together.  

The default set of modules includes and it's not limited to: 
* admin commands 
* trivia (lists included and you can make new ones!)
* music features (playlists, youtube, soundcloud, queues...)
* stream alerts (twitch/hitbox)
* slot machines (yes, really!)
* custom commands
* imgur/gif search
* and much much more

Red is in continuous development and new features get added all the time. Stay tuned by [joining the official server](https://discord.gg/0k4npTwMvTpv9wrh)!
