##Aliases

Being able to add aliases is a useful function of the bot that is often overlooked.  

If used right, aliases can add a lot to the bot and to your community with little to no "coding".  
With a little creative thinking and maybe some coding here and there, aliases can add a lot of functionality that isn't inherent in the bot.


This page will assume you have `!` as your prefix. If you have a different prefix, simple substitute `!` with yours.

First comes first. Do `!help Alias` and look through the commands a bit. Try making some of your own aliases.

The purpose of aliases is to let you call a command using a different name. Here are a few examples that demonstrate that.

Aliases are case-sensitive

`!alias add NO flip`  
`!NO`  
_flips a coin and... HEADS!_

You can use the command inputs like normal  
`!NO Kowlin`
