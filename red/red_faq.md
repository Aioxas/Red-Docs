### How do I make it join my server?

[See the getting started guide.](/Red-Docs/red_getting_started/)

### I can't seem to input the commands in the console. Is this the correct way?

[No, it is not. Red is a chatbot, commands go in the chat.](/Red-Docs/red_getting_started)

### How do I make it join a channel? / I installed and it won't join a voice channel

Red *has no need* to get into a voice channel as soon as it gets installed nor *you need* to make her join manually.  
What you're actually asking is: **how do I use the music part of this bot?**  
The answer is: use *any* audio command that makes it play audio. [Read more about how to see the commands here](https://twentysix26.github.io/Red-Docs/red_getting_started/#the-commands). If for some reason the commands are not present, try loading the audio cog. [As explained here](https://twentysix26.github.io/Red-Docs/red_getting_started/#cogs), this is done by issuing `[p]load audio`. Assuming you properly followed the installation guide and installed the requirements, it will get loaded.  
A good way to test is `[p]play` with a random YouTube URL.

### How do I go back to the initial configuration? I want to check some settings

You don't, use `[p]set` instead.

### How do I change the avatar?

See `[p]set`.

### How do I change the prefix?

See `[p]set`.
