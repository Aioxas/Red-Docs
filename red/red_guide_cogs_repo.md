# Official Cogs can be downloaded from inside the bot. Do `!cog list` for official cogs.

***Disclaimer: these have not been screened by the almighty overlord, Twentysix. It is your own fault if something goes wrong whilst installing/using these cogs, and we are not liable to help you fix it.*** Despite this, they *should* be stable.

If any of these cogs are outdated or don't work anymore, send `fishyfing` a PM, and he'll update the repo. For general help, ask the cog creator.  

## Installation  

Download the file and copy to `/Red-DiscordBot/cogs/`

## List of cogs  

### Emotes  

This cog adds a listener that detects when Twitch emotes are said in chat. It will then post an image of that emote.
